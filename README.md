Final project for Client/Server Dev Class

As a computer scientist, I strive to write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable. To achieve this, I follow the best coding practices such as writing clean, organized, and well-documented code. For the CRUD Python module, I made sure that the code was modular and reusable, making it easy to adapt to different use cases. Using this module to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two had several advantages, including saving time and minimizing errors in code duplication. In the future, I could use the same module to create, update, and delete data in other applications or projects, thereby minimizing the amount of redundant code and improving the maintainability and adaptability of my work.

When approaching a problem as a computer scientist, I start by breaking down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts. For the database and dashboard requirements in Project Two, I identified the necessary data fields, the relationships between the different tables, and the various widgets needed to display the data. Compared to previous assignments, this project required more planning and careful consideration of the client's needs. In the future, I would use similar techniques, such as creating a data dictionary, to organize and prioritize client requests, and working collaboratively with the client to ensure that the final product meets their needs.

Computer scientists solve problems using computer programs and technology. Our work matters because it helps individuals, organizations, and society as a whole. In the case of Grazioso Salvare, our work on this project would help them manage their pet adoption data more effectively, allowing them to make informed decisions based on the information presented in the dashboard. It would also streamline their adoption process, reducing the time and effort required to manage and track pets. Ultimately, computer scientists help companies and organizations to work more efficiently and effectively, improving their bottom line and overall performance.
